<p class="h2">General questions about quantum information science</p>
<p><strong>What does “quantum” mean?</strong></p>
<p>Quantum theory is a revolutionary advancement in physics and chemistry
that emerged in the early twentieth century. It is an elegant
mathematical theory able to explain the counterintuitive behavior of
subatomic particles, most notably the phenomenon of <strong>entanglement</strong>.
In the late twentieth century it was discovered that quantum theory
applies not only to atoms and molecules, but to bits and logic
operations in a computer. This realization has been bringing about a
revolution in the science and technology of information processing,
making possible kinds of computing and communication hitherto unknown
in the Information Age.</p>
<p><strong>What is a quantum computer?</strong></p>
<p>A quantum computer is a device able to manipulate delicate quantum
states in a controlled fashion, not dissimilar to the way an ordinary
computer manipulates its bits.</p>
<p><strong>What is a qubit?</strong></p>
<p>A qubit (pronounced “cue-bit” and short for quantum bit) is the physical
carrier of quantum information. It is the quantum version of a bit, and
its quantum state can take values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|0\rangle\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|1\rangle\)</span>,
or the linear combination of both, which is a phenomenon known as <strong>superposition</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is a superposition?</strong></p>
<p>A superposition is a weighted sum or difference of two or more states;
for example, the state of the air when two or more musical tones
sound at once. Ordinary, or “classical,” superpositions commonly
occur in macroscopic phenomena involving waves.</p>
<p><strong>How are quantum superpositions different?</strong></p>
<p>Quantum theory predicts that a computer with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> qubits can exist in a
superposition of all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^n\)</span> of its distinct logical states
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|000..0\rangle\)</span>, through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|111…1\rangle\)</span>. This is exponentially
more than a classical superposition. Playing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> musical tones at once
can only produce a superposition of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> states.</p>
<p><strong>How is superposition different from probability?</strong></p>
<p>A set of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> coins, each of which might be heads or tails, can be
described as a probabilistic mixture of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^n\)</span> states, but it actually
<strong>is</strong> in only one of them — we just don’t know which. For this reason,
quantum superposition is more powerful than classical probabilism.
Quantum computers capable of holding their data in superposition can
solve some problems exponentially faster than any known deterministic or
probabilistic classical algorithm. A more technical difference is that
while probabilities must be positive (or zero), the weights in a
superposition can be positive, negative, or even complex numbers.</p>
<p><strong>How is a quantum superposition different from exponential
parallelism?</strong></p>
<p>Just as a superposition is stronger than a probabilistic mixture, so it
is weaker than actually having an exponentially large army of real
computers (which is an unrealistic proposition in any case, since the
observable universe isn’t big enough to hold <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{100}\)</span> of anything).
The power of quantum computers remains to be explored, but it is
considered to be strictly weaker than exponential parallelism, and
strictly stronger than probabilism.</p>
<p><strong>What is entanglement?</strong></p>
<p>Entanglement is a property of most quantum superpositions and does not
occur in classical superpositions. In an entangled state, the whole
system is in a definite state, even though the parts are not. Observing
one of two entangled particles causes it to behave randomly, but tells
the observer how the other particle would act if a similar observation
were made on it. Because entanglement involves a correlation between
individually random behaviors of the two particles, it cannot be used to
send a message. Therefore, the term “instantaneous action at a
distance,” sometimes used to describe entanglement, is a misnomer. There
is no <strong>action</strong> (in the sense of something that can be used to exert a
controllable influence or send a message) – only <strong>correlation</strong>,
which, though uncannily perfect, can only be detected afterward when the
two observers compare notes. The ability of quantum computers to exist
in entangled states is responsible for much of their extra computing
power, as well as many other feats of quantum information processing
that cannot be performed, or even described, classically.</p>
<p><strong>What is the uncertainty principle?</strong></p>
<p>In quantum physics, we cannot simultaneously know two non-commuting
variables (like the position and momentum of a particle). This implies
that a quantum system in a perfectly definite state can be certain
under one measurement and completely random under another.&nbsp; Moreover,
if a quantum system starts out in an arbitrary&nbsp;unknown state, no
measurement can reveal complete information about that state; the
more information the measurement reveals, the more the state is
disturbed.&nbsp; This is a underlying principle of quantum cryptography.</p>
<p><strong>What is a quantum gate?</strong></p>
<p>A quantum gate is an operation applied to a qubit to change its
state. To generate entanglement you must have at least a two-qubit gate
equivalent to the CNOT.</p>
<p class="h2">Questions about quantum computers</p>
<p><strong>Can a&nbsp;quantum computer&nbsp;solve NP-complete problems?</strong></p>
<p>We do not believe that quantum computers are likely to provide any
more than a quadratic speedup to NP-complete problems. This is the
consensus view of the quantum information research community, and in
fact the idea that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems
efficiently has been described as “<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec10.html">the *central* crock about quantum
computing</a>”.</p>
<p><strong>What is a universal quantum computer?</strong></p>
<p>A universal quantum computer is a machine that can simulate an arbitrary
quantum state from an arbitrary input quantum state.</p>
<p><strong>What is a&nbsp;universal fault-tolerant quantum computer?</strong></p>
<p>A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer is the grand challenge of
quantum computing. It is a device that can properly perform universal
quantum operations using unreliable components.</p>
<p><strong>When will I have a quantum computer?</strong></p>
<p>You have access to one now with the IBM Q Experience. It is small
at the moment, but it is a work-in-progress that we are continually improving.</p>
<p><strong>What is a quantum circuit?</strong></p>
<p>A quantum circuit is the set of instructions, or algorithm, to a quantum
computer. It is a series of gates versus time played on different
qubits.</p>
<p><strong>What does a quantum computer look like?</strong></p>
<p>A quantum computer looks like nothing you have on your desk, or in your
office, or in your pocket. It is housed in a large unit known as a
dilution refrigerator and is supported by multiple racks of electronic
pulse-generating equipment. However, you can access our quantum computer
with very familiar personal computing devices, such as laptops, tablets,
and smartphones.</p>
<p class="h2">General questions about the IBM Q Experience</p>
<p><strong>What is the IBM Q Experience?</strong></p>
<p>The IBM Q Experience is a cloud-based platform where you can
learn, research, and interact with a real quantum computer housed in an
IBM Research lab.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Quantum Composer?</strong></p>
<p>The Quantum Composer is a graphical interface tool where you can drag
and drop different operations to control qubits. The Quantum Composer
permits you to develop your own quantum algorithms, which we call
Quantum Scores.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Quantum Score?</strong></p>
<p>A Quantum Score is the set of instructions, or algorithm, to a quantum
computer. It is a series of gates versus time played on different
qubits, much like a musical score. It is also called a quantum circuit.</p>
<p class="h2">Questions about our qubits and experiments</p>
<p><strong>What is the qubit that you are physically using?</strong></p>
<p>The qubit we use is a fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubit.
It is a Josephson-junction-based qubit that is insensitive to charge
noise. For more information on this type of qubit please see here
(<a class="reference external" href="http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042319">Koch *et al.*
2007</a>).
We use fixed-frequency qubits, as opposed to tunable qubits, to
minimize our sensitivity to external magnetic field fluctuations that
could corrupt the quantum information.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make the qubits?</strong></p>
<p>The superconducting qubits are fabricated at IBM. The devices are made
on silicon wafers with superconducting metals such as niobium and
aluminum. Details about the fabrication processes are given in these
references (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140624/ncomms5015/full/ncomms5015.html">Chow *et al.* 2014</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150429/ncomms7979/full/ncomms7979.html">Córcoles *et al.* 2015</a>).</p>
<p><strong>What are the properties of these qubits?</strong></p>
<p>The properties of the qubits can be seen in the Devices tab.
Properties such as relaxation time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_1\)</span>), coherence time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_2\)</span>),
readout errors, and gate errors are given, posted from the last
calibration experiment run on the actual quantum processor device.</p>
<p><strong>Where do the qubits live?</strong></p>
<p>The quantum processor itself is housed inside of a printed circuit board
package. This package is mounted inside of a light-tight, magnetic-field
shielding can, which sits at the coldest stage at the bottom of a
dilution refrigerator, housed in one of IBM’s Quantum Computing labs.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a dilution refrigerator?</strong></p>
<p>A dilution refrigerator is the machine we use to cool down our quantum
processor device. The refrigerator cools the device down to around 15
miliKelvin. It works by circulating a mixture of two helium isotopes,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span> He and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{4}\)</span> He, in a closed cycle within a complex system
of pipes and chambers.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when I hit the “Run” button?</strong></p>
<p>The graphical quantum score is first interpreted, then compiled to run
efficiently on a particular qubit configuration. The compiled version is
translated into a sequence of operations performed by equipment in our
lab to control the qubits. The output is then passed back to the user,
and a note is sent to your email address to alert you that the quantum
hardware has run your experiment.</p>
<p><strong>How are quantum gates performed in the system?</strong></p>
<p>Quantum gates are performed by sending electromagnetic impulses at
microwave frequencies to the qubits through coaxial cables. These
electromagnetic pulses have a particular duration, frequency, and phase
that determine the angle of rotation of the qubit state around a
particular axis of the Bloch sphere. For single-qubit operations, only
one pulse type needs to be calibrated, namely <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_{\pi/2}\)</span>. From that
pulse, we can create all the gates you find in the Quantum Composer
library. For example, we implement the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> gate with the help of a
phase transform performed purely in software, which affects the physical
implementation of subsequent gates; however, this does not mean that the
gate is necessarily error-free, as doing a software phase transform
still requires very good phase stability from our instruments! Another
example is the Hadamard gate performed by the sequence

<p><strong>What about two-qubit gates?</strong></p>
<p>Two-qubit gates typically require tuning to calibrate the interaction
between the two qubits during the gate duration, and minimizing the
interaction at any other time. Since our qubits of choice are
fixed-frequency transmons, we cannot tune the interaction by bringing
them closer in frequency during the two-qubit gate. Instead, we
exploit the cross-resonance effect (<a class="reference external" href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.080502">Chow *et al*.,
2011</a>),
by driving one of the qubits (called <strong>control</strong>) with a microwave
pulse tuned at the frequency of the second qubit (called <strong>target</strong>).
By doing this, we can actively increase the strength of the coupling
between them. The nature of the cross-resonance effect also allows us
to perform rotations in the target qubit conditioned on the state of
the control qubit, a key characteristic of the CNOT operation required
for a universal quantum gate set. From our cross-resonance microwave
pulse, we only need to perform an additional frame change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> on the
control qubit and a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_{\pi/2}\)</span> on the target to implement a CNOT.</p>
<p><strong>How are&nbsp;measurements performed in the system?</strong></p>
<p>We must perform the qubit measurements in a way that does not destroy
the qubit quantum state. One method is to weakly couple each qubit to a
microwave resonator whose resonance characteristics depend on the state
of the qubit. Once the qubit operations are completed in your score, you
can measure the qubits by sending a microwave tone to their resonators
and analyzing the signal it reflects back. The phase and amplitude of
this reflected signal will be different depending on the qubit state.
These signals in the resonator are boosted via a chain of amplifiers
inside of our dilution refrigerator, including a quantum-limited
amplifier at 15 mK, and a high-electron mobility transistor amplifier at
4 K.</p>
<p>Do not forget to include measurements in your score! Because the
measurement of a qubit in a superposition state seems random – the
outcome is sometimes 0 and sometimes 1 – you must repeat the
measurement multiple times to determine the likelihood of a qubit
being in a particular state. When performing the experiment, you will
be asked how many “shots” or experiments to run in order to determine
the qubit state probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>How often is the system tuned up?</strong></p>
<p>We perform a full round of single- and two-qubit calibrations, as well
as measurements of relaxation time, coherence time, and gate errors
two times a day at 8AM and 8PM EST. Each full calibration round takes
about one hour.&nbsp; During calibration, you will notice that the device
will be “Down for Maintenance.”</p>
<p class="h2">Questions about running the simulator versus the experiment</p>
<p><strong>What does the simulator do?</strong></p>
<p>The simulator computes the quantum state we expect a circuit to
produce.</p>
<p><strong>How many experiments can I run?</strong></p>
<p>You can run as many experiments as you have Units to run; each
experiment execution requires between 3 and 5 Units. No Units are
required to perform simulations or to recall results of an experiment
that was run previously.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when I run out of Units?</strong></p>
<p>You can still run simulations or recall the result of the experiments
that have been run previously, but you must wait for the Units to
replenish, which happens either once your execution has run off the
queue, or 24 hours, whichever is greater.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between “Current Units” and “Promo Units”?</strong></p>
<p>The maximum number of “Current Units” available is based on your user
level.&nbsp; A  User has a maximum of 15 credits, and these credits
are replenished upon the greater of 24 hours or when your execution has
run off the queue. On the other hand, “Promo Units” are extra units that
allow you to run extra executions but, once used, these credits won’t be
replenished. If you have “Promo Units”, these will be used first rather
than “Current Units”.</p>
